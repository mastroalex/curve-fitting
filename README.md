In impedance cytometry various techniques have been developed, both design and post processing, to improve measurement accuracy. 

One of the parameters that most afflicts the measurements of cytometry is the dependence of the signal on the position of the cell within the channel for which identical cells, passing in different positions, give rise to different signals. The following report analyzes a planar electrode configuration and the dependence of the signals from the position inside the microfluidic channel. 

Here is then analyzed and applied compensation technique on a dataset deriving from measurements on families with three different diameters electrical. 

A mapping according to the straight line interpolating the shape parameter and the normalized diameter allows to remove the position contribution and separate the signals of families with different diameters, then go back to the individual distributions by eliminating the position contribution.
